The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - @docsearch/css@3.2.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @docsearch/css

Style package for [DocSearch](http://docsearch.algolia.com/), the best search experience for docs.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @docsearch/css@3
# or
npm install @docsearch/css@3
```

If you don’t want to use a package manager, you can use a standalone endpoint:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@docsearch/css@3"></script>
```

## Get started

```js
import '@docsearch/css';
```

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - @docsearch/js@3.2.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @docsearch/js

JavaScript package for [DocSearch](http://docsearch.algolia.com/), the best search experience for docs.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add @docsearch/js@3
# or
npm install @docsearch/js@3
```

## Get started

If you don’t want to use a package manager, you can use a standalone endpoint:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@docsearch/js@3"></script>
```

To get started, you need a [`container`](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/api#container) for your DocSearch component to go in. If you don’t have one already, you can insert one into your markup:

```html
<div id="docsearch"></div>
```

Then, insert DocSearch into it by calling the [`docsearch`](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/api) function and providing the container. It can be a [CSS selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/css/css_selectors) or an [Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/api/htmlelement).

Make sure to provide a [`container`](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/api#container) (for example, a `div`), not an `input`. DocSearch generates a fully accessible search box for you.

```js app.js
import docsearch from '@docsearch/js';

import '@docsearch/css';

docsearch({
  container: '#docsearch',
  appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
  indexName: 'YOUR_INDEX_NAME',
  apiKey: 'YOUR_SEARCH_API_KEY',
});
```

If you don’t want to use a package manager, you can use a standalone endpoint:

      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

# @rollup/pluginutils

A set of utility functions commonly used by 🍣 Rollup plugins.

## Requirements

This plugin requires an [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) Node version (v8.0.0+) and Rollup v1.20.0+.

## Install

Using npm:

```console
npm install @rollup/pluginutils --save-dev
```

## Usage

```js
import utils from '@rollup/pluginutils';
//...
```

## API

Available utility functions are listed below:

_Note: Parameter names immediately followed by a `?` indicate that the parameter is optional._

### addExtension

Adds an extension to a module ID if one does not exist.

Parameters: `(filename: String, ext?: String)`<br>
Returns: `String`

```js
import { addExtension } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

export default function myPlugin(options = {}) {
  return {
    resolveId(code, id) {
      // only adds an extension if there isn't one already
      id = addExtension(id); // `foo` -> `foo.js`, `foo.js` -> `foo.js`
      id = addExtension(id, '.myext'); // `foo` -> `foo.myext`, `foo.js` -> `foo.js`
    }
  };
}
```

### attachScopes

Attaches `Scope` objects to the relevant nodes of an AST. Each `Scope` object has a `scope.contains(name)` method that returns `true` if a given name is defined in the current scope or a parent scope.

Parameters: `(ast: Node, propertyName?: String)`<br>
Returns: `Object`

See [rollup-plugin-inject](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-inject) or [rollup-plugin-commonjs](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-commonjs) for an example of usage.

```js
import { attachScopes } from '@rollup/pluginutils';
import { walk } from 'estree-walker';

export default function myPlugin(options = {}) {
  return {
    transform(code) {
      const ast = this.parse(code);

      let scope = attachScopes(ast, 'scope');

      walk(ast, {
        enter(node) {
          if (node.scope) scope = node.scope;

          if (!scope.contains('foo')) {
            // `foo` is not defined, so if we encounter it,
            // we assume it's a global
          }
        },
        leave(node) {
          if (node.scope) scope = scope.parent;
        }
      });
    }
  };
}
```

### createFilter

Constructs a filter function which can be used to determine whether or not certain modules should be operated upon.

Parameters: `(include?: <picomatch>, exclude?: <picomatch>, options?: Object)`<br>
Returns: `String`

#### `include` and `exclude`

Type: `String | RegExp | Array[...String|RegExp]`<br>

A valid [`picomatch`](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#globbing-features) pattern, or array of patterns. If `options.include` is omitted or has zero length, filter will return `true` by default. Otherwise, an ID must match one or more of the `picomatch` patterns, and must not match any of the `options.exclude` patterns.

Note that `picomatch` patterns are very similar to [`minimatch`](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#readme) patterns, and in most use cases, they are interchangeable. If you have more specific pattern matching needs, you can view [this comparison table](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#library-comparisons) to learn more about where the libraries differ.

#### `options`

##### `resolve`

Type: `String | Boolean | null`

Optionally resolves the patterns against a directory other than `process.cwd()`. If a `String` is specified, then the value will be used as the base directory. Relative paths will be resolved against `process.cwd()` first. If `false`, then the patterns will not be resolved against any directory. This can be useful if you want to create a filter for virtual module names.

#### Usage

```js
import { createFilter } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

export default function myPlugin(options = {}) {
  // assume that the myPlugin accepts options of `options.include` and `options.exclude`
  var filter = createFilter(options.include, options.exclude, {
    resolve: '/my/base/dir'
  });

  return {
    transform(code, id) {
      if (!filter(id)) return;

      // proceed with the transformation...
    }
  };
}
```

### dataToEsm

Transforms objects into tree-shakable ES Module imports.

Parameters: `(data: Object)`<br>
Returns: `String`

#### `data`

Type: `Object`

An object to transform into an ES module.

#### Usage

```js
import { dataToEsm } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

const esModuleSource = dataToEsm(
  {
    custom: 'data',
    to: ['treeshake']
  },
  {
    compact: false,
    indent: '\t',
    preferConst: false,
    objectShorthand: false,
    namedExports: true
  }
);
/*
Outputs the string ES module source:
  export const custom = 'data';
  export const to = ['treeshake'];
  export default { custom, to };
*/
```

### extractAssignedNames

Extracts the names of all assignment targets based upon specified patterns.

Parameters: `(param: Node)`<br>
Returns: `Array[...String]`

#### `param`

Type: `Node`

An `acorn` AST Node.

#### Usage

```js
import { extractAssignedNames } from '@rollup/pluginutils';
import { walk } from 'estree-walker';

export default function myPlugin(options = {}) {
  return {
    transform(code) {
      const ast = this.parse(code);

      walk(ast, {
        enter(node) {
          if (node.type === 'VariableDeclarator') {
            const declaredNames = extractAssignedNames(node.id);
            // do something with the declared names
            // e.g. for `const {x, y: z} = ...` => declaredNames = ['x', 'z']
          }
        }
      });
    }
  };
}
```

### makeLegalIdentifier

Constructs a bundle-safe identifier from a `String`.

Parameters: `(str: String)`<br>
Returns: `String`

#### Usage

```js
import { makeLegalIdentifier } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

makeLegalIdentifier('foo-bar'); // 'foo_bar'
makeLegalIdentifier('typeof'); // '_typeof'
```

### normalizePath

Converts path separators to forward slash.

Parameters: `(filename: String)`<br>
Returns: `String`

#### Usage

```js
import { normalizePath } from '@rollup/pluginutils';

normalizePath('foo\\bar'); // 'foo/bar'
normalizePath('foo/bar'); // 'foo/bar'
```

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - @yext/custom-field-debugger@2.0.6

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Custom Field Debugger

Custom Field Debugger works on Yext pages to markup and highlight HTML elements which use data from Yext Knowledge Graph

## Usage
On a Yext pages site, install the NPM package:

```
npm install @yext/custom-field-debugger
```

Then, use the React component, for example:

```
// src/templates/index.tsx:

import { CustomFieldDebuggerReactProvider } from '@yext/custom-field-debugger';

...

const Index = (props) => {
  return (
    <CustomFieldDebuggerReactProvider>
      // Index template jsx here
    </CustomFieldDebuggerReactProvider>
  )
}
```

On the page rendered with this template, you can add the URL parameter `yextCFDebug=true` to enable the Custom Field Debugger.

## Development
1. Make some changes to the repo.
2. Add `"@yext/custom-field-debugger": "file:../custom-field-debugger",` to `package.json` to load your changes locally into a repo for testing.
3. `npm run release` in this repo to build the TS files, and generate the TS types
4. `npm install` in the testing repo to fetch the newly built files

## Deployment
1. Make & commit changes - don't forget to increment the version number
2. `npm run relase` to compile TS to JS, and generate TS types
3. `npm publish` to update the package on npmjs


## Common issues (?)
- The version of `react` and `react-dom` in this repo must match that of the pages repo this package is used in

## ✨ Features

- Thin & **minimal low-level HTTP client** to interact with Algolia's API
- Works both on the **browser** and **node.js**
- **UMD compatible**, you can use it with any module loader
- Built with TypeScript

## 💡 Getting Started

First, install Algolia JavaScript API Client via the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) package manager:

```bash
npm install algoliasearch
```

Then, create objects on your index:

```js
const algoliasearch = require("algoliasearch");

const client = algoliasearch("YourApplicationID", "YourAdminAPIKey");
const index = client.initIndex("your_index_name");

const objects = [
  {
    objectID: 1,
    name: "Foo"
  }
];

index
  .saveObjects(objects)
  .then(({ objectIDs }) => {
    console.log(objectIDs);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err);
  });
```

Finally, let's actually search using the `search` method:

```js
index
  .search("Fo")
  .then(({ hits }) => {
    console.log(hits);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.log(err);

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - dlv@1.1.3

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# `dlv(obj, keypath)` [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dlv.svg)](https://npmjs.com/package/dlv) [![Build](https://travis-ci.org/developit/dlv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/developit/dlv)

> Safely get a dot-notated path within a nested object, with ability to return a default if the full key path does not exist or the value is undefined


### Why?

Smallest possible implementation: only **130 bytes.**

You could write this yourself, but then you'd have to write [tests].

Supports ES Modules, CommonJS and globals.


### Installation

`npm install --save dlv`


### Usage

`delve(object, keypath, [default])`

```js
import delve from 'dlv';

let obj = {
	a: {
		b: {
			c: 1,
			d: undefined,
			e: null
		}
	}
};

//use string dot notation for keys
delve(obj, 'a.b.c') === 1;

//or use an array key
delve(obj, ['a', 'b', 'c']) === 1;

delve(obj, 'a.b') === obj.a.b;

//returns undefined if the full key path does not exist and no default is specified
delve(obj, 'a.b.f') === undefined;

//optional third parameter for default if the full key in path is missing
delve(obj, 'a.b.f', 'foo') === 'foo';

//or if the key exists but the value is undefined
delve(obj, 'a.b.d', 'foo') === 'foo';

//Non-truthy defined values are still returned if they exist at the full keypath
delve(obj, 'a.b.e', 'foo') === null;

//undefined obj or key returns undefined, unless a default is supplied
delve(undefined, 'a.b.c') === undefined;
delve(undefined, 'a.b.c', 'foo') === 'foo';
delve(obj, undefined, 'foo') === 'foo';
```


### Setter Counterparts

- [dset](https://github.com/lukeed/dset) by [@lukeed](https://github.com/lukeed) is the spiritual "set" counterpart of `dlv` and very fast.
- [bury](https://github.com/kalmbach/bury) by [@kalmbach](https://github.com/kalmbach) does the opposite of `dlv` and is implemented in a very similar manner.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - esm-module-paths@1.1.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# esm-module-paths

ESM modules don't allow to use [`__dirname`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html#modules_dirname) and [`__filename`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html#modules_filename) do determine a `.js` file's location.
Instead, you need to copy/paste [multiple lines and expressions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50052194) each time to achieve the same.

This package makes this a bit easier.

## Usage

Imagine a file in `./your/path/index.js`

```js
import { getModulePaths } from "esm-module-paths";

const { __dirname, __filename } = getModulePaths();

console.log(__dirname); // /your/path
console.log(__filename); // /your/path/index.js
```

For convenience reasons, the library also exports `__filename` and `__dirname` as functions, which can be used independently.

```js
import { __filename, __dirname } from "esm-module-paths";

console.log(__dirname()); // /your/path
console.log(__filename()); // /your/path/index.js
```

Since `__dirname` and `__filename` being functions may be confusing to some, especially since those used to be variables, this package also exports aliased, more descriptive versions of each function.

```js
import { getFileName, getDirName } from "esm-module-paths";

console.log(getDirName()); // /your/path
console.log(getFileName()); // /your/path/index.js
```

## Installation

```sh
npm install esm-module-paths
```

or

```sh
yarn add esm-module-paths
```

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - murmurhash-js@1.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# MurmurHash.js

An optimized JavaScript implementation of the MurmurHash algorithms.

These algorithms take a JavaScript string (and a seed), and quickly create a non-cryptographic 32-bit hash from it. And by quick I mean sub-millisecond performance.

More information about these algorithms can be found at:

*	[MurmurHash Homepage](http://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/)
*	[Wikipedia Entry on MurmurHash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash) 

## Install

    npm install murmurhash-js
    
## API

```javascript
var murmur = require("murmurhash-js")
```

### Methods

#### `murmur.murmur2(key, seed)`
Runs the murmur2 hash algorithm on the string `key` with initial seed `seed`.

#### `murmur.murmur3(key, seed)`
Runs the murmur3 hash algorithm on the string `key` with initial seed `seed`.

**Note** `require("murmur-hash")` is the same as `murmur.murmur3`

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - react-devtools-core@4.25.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# `react-devtools-core`

This package provides low-level APIs to support renderers like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native). If you're looking for the standalone React DevTools UI, **we suggest using [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) instead of using this package directly**.

This package provides two entrypoints: labeled "backend" and "standalone" (frontend). Both APIs are described below.

# Backend API

Backend APIs are embedded in _development_ builds of renderers like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) in order to connect to the React DevTools UI.

### Example

If you are building a non-browser-based React renderer, you can use the backend API like so:

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  const { connectToDevTools } = require("react-devtools-core");

  // Must be called before packages like react or react-native are imported
  connectToDevTools({
    ...config
  });
}
```

> **NOTE** that this API (`connectToDevTools`) must be (1) run in the same context as React and (2) must be called before React packages are imported (e.g. `react`, `react-dom`, `react-native`).

### `connectToDevTools` options
| Prop | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `host` | `"localhost"` | Socket connection to frontend should use this host. |
| `isAppActive` |  | (Optional) function that returns true/false, telling DevTools when it's ready to connect to React. |
| `port` | `8097` | Socket connection to frontend should use this port. |
| `resolveRNStyle` |  | (Optional) function that accepts a key (number) and returns a style (object); used by React Native. |
| `retryConnectionDelay` | `200` | Delay (ms) to wait between retrying a failed Websocket connection |
| `useHttps` | `false` | Socket connection to frontend should use secure protocol (wss). |
| `websocket` |  | Custom `WebSocket` connection to frontend; overrides `host` and `port` settings. |

# Frontend API

Frontend APIs can be used to render the DevTools UI into a DOM node. One example of this is [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) which wraps DevTools in an Electron app.

### Example
```js
import DevtoolsUI from "react-devtools-core/standalone";

// See the full list of API methods in documentation below.
const { setContentDOMNode, startServer } = DevtoolsUI;

// Render DevTools UI into a DOM element.
setContentDOMNode(document.getElementById("container"));

// Start socket server used to communicate between backend and frontend.
startServer(
  // Port defaults to 8097
  1234,

  // Host defaults to "localhost"
  "example.devserver.com",

  // Optional config for secure socket (WSS).
  {
    key: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-key.pem'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-cert.pem')
  }
);
```

### Exported methods
The `default` export is an object defining the methods described below.

These methods support chaining for convenience. For example:
```js
const DevtoolsUI = require("react-devtools-core/standalone");
DevtoolsUI.setContentDOMNode(element).startServer();
```

#### `connectToSocket(socket: WebSocket)`
> This is an advanced config function that is typically not used.

Custom `WebSocket` connection to use for communication between DevTools frontend and backend. Calling this method automatically initializes the DevTools UI (similar to calling `startServer()`).

#### `openProfiler()`
Automatically select the "Profiler" tab in the DevTools UI.

#### `setContentDOMNode(element: HTMLElement)`
Set the DOM element DevTools UI should be rendered into on initialization.

#### `setDisconnectedCallback(callback: Function)`
_Optional_ callback to be notified when DevTools `WebSocket` closes (or errors).

#### `setProjectRoots(roots: Array<string>)`
_Optional_ set of root directores for source files. These roots can be used to open an inspected component's source code using an IDE.

#### `setStatusListener(callback: Function)`
_Optional_ callback to be notified of socket server events (e.g. initialized, errored, connected).

This callback receives two parameters:
```js
function onStatus(
  message: string,
  status: 'server-connected' | 'devtools-connected' | 'error'
): void {
  // ...
}
```

#### `startServer(port?: number, host?: string, httpsOptions?: Object, loggerOptions?: Object)`
Start a socket server (used to communicate between backend and frontend) and renders the DevTools UI.

This method accepts the following parameters:
| Name | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `port` | `8097` | Socket connection to backend should use this port. |
| `host` | `"localhost"` | Socket connection to backend should use this host. |
| `httpsOptions` | | _Optional_ object defining `key` and `cert` strings. |
| `loggerOptions` | | _Optional_ object defining a `surface` string (to be included with DevTools logging events). |

# Development

Watch for changes made to the backend entry point and rebuild:
```sh
yarn start:backend
```

Watch for changes made to the standalone UI entry point and rebuild:
```sh
yarn start:standalone
```

Run the standalone UI using `yarn start` in the [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools).

![Example implementation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JonasBa/recent-searches/master/RecentSearchesUX.gif)

## The problem

Building recent searches experience can be trickier than you think (expiry of queries, ranking of recent queries, handling storage etc...)

## Solution
recent-searches module helps you build that experience without having to focus on the edge cases and technical details. If available, uses [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to store suggestions cross sessions and in the rare cases where it might not be available uses a fallback memory storage, thus loosing it's cross session functionality.

__The module handles:__
- Searching and retrieving recent searches
- Ranking of searches and decaying their popularity (with different ranking options)
- Saving and expiring of searches through LocalStorage or MemoryStorage
- LocalStorage feature detection (with fallback to MemoryStorage)
- Safe LocalStorage usage (feature detection, limiting storage)

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

> 
>   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
> freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
> License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
> software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
> General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
> Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
> using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
> the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
> your programs, too.
> 
>   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
> price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
> have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
> this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
> if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
> in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
> 
>   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
> anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
> These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
> distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
> 
>   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
> gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
> you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
> source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
> rights.
> 
>   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
> (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
> distribute and/or modify the software.
> 
>   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
> that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
> software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
> want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
> that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
> authors' reputations.
> 
>   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
> patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
> program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
> program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
> patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
> 
>   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
> modification follow.

> under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
> refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
> means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
> that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
> either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
> language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
> the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
> 
> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
> covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
> running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
> is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
> Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
> Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
> 
>   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
> source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
> conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
> copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
> notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
> and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
> along with the Program.
> 
> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
> you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
> 
>   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
> of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
> distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
> above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
> 
>     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
>     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
> 
>     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
>     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
>     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
>     parties under the terms of this License.
> 
>     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
>     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
>     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
>     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
>     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
>     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
>     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
>     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
>     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
>     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
> 
> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
> identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
> and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
> themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
> sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
> distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
> on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
> this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
> entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
> 
> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
> your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
> exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
> collective works based on the Program.
> 
> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
> with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
> a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
> the scope of this License.
> 
>   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
> under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
> Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
> 
>     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
>     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
>     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
>     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
>     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
>     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
>     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
>     customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
>     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
>     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
>     received the program in object code or executable form with such
>     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
> 
> The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
> making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
> code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
> associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
> control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
> special exception, the source code distributed need not include
> anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
> form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
> operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
> itself accompanies the executable.
> 
> If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
> access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
> access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
> distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
> compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
> 
>   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
> except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
> otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
> void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
> However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
> this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
> parties remain in full compliance.
> 
>   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
> signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
> distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
> prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
> modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
> all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
> the Program or works based on it.
> 
>   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
> original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
> these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
> restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
> You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
> this License.
> 
>   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
> infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
> conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
> excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
> distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
> License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
> may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
> license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
> all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
> the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
> refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
> 
> If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
> any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
> apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
> circumstances.
> 
> It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
> patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
> such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
> integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
> implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
> generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
> through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
> system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
> to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
> impose that choice.
> 
> This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
> be a consequence of the rest of this License.
> 
>   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
> certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
> original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
> may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
> those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
> countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
> the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
> 
>   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
> of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
> be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
> address new problems or concerns.
> 
> Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
> specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
> later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
> either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
> Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
> this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
> Foundation.
> 
>   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
> programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
> to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
> Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
> make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
> of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
> of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
> 
>           NO WARRANTY
> 
>   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
> FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
> OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
> PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
> OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
> MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
> TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
> PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
> REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
> 
>   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
> WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
> REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
> INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
> OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
> TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
> YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
> PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
> POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
